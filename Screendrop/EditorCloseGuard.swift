//  EditorCloseGuard.swift

//
//  Closing an editor window with uncommitted edits asks first - Studio and
//  the annotation editor both use this. SwiftUI has no
//  `windowShouldClose` hook, so this installs itself as the window delegate
//  and forwards every other message to the delegate SwiftUI already set -
//  taking over the window outright would break scene teardown.
