//  Screen captures are recorded without the OS cursor (see
//  ScreenRecordingManager.buildConfiguration) and keep the camera as a
//  separate movie, so a session's raw screen master is never what the user
//  saw. Anything that hands a recording to the user - Save, Copy, upload -
//  has to go through here first, or it ships a video with no pointer, no
//  camera bubble, and none of the project's edits.
